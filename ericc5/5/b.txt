I believe it could be either A or B.
It could be A because it's possible for baz() to be called before the fetches,
and for bar() to be called before foo(), causing an infinite while loop as getUsers
can't get updated by foo().  As a result, foo() will never get called.
It could be B because if foo() is called prior to bar(), bar() wouldn't hang in the
while loop and baz() could be called afterwards.
However, for option C, it is not possible for foo() to run after bar(), as getUsers
won't update to true, causing bar() to hang with foo() never getting called.
